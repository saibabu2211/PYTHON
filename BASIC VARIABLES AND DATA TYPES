Variables and Data Types
Variables

Variables are like containers for storing values.
Values in the variables can be changed.

Values

Consider that variables are like containers for storing information.
In context of programming, this information is often referred to as value.

Data Type
In programming languages, every value or data has an associated type to it known as data type.
Some commonly used data types

String
Integer
Float
Boolean
This data type determines how the value or data can be used in the program. For example, mathematical operations can be done on Integer and Float types of data.

String

A String is a stream of characters enclosed within quotes.
Stream of Characters

Capital Letters ( A – Z )
Small Letters ( a – z )
Digits ( 0 – 9 )
Special Characters (~ ! @ # $ % ^ . ?,)
Space
Some Examples

"Hello World!"
"some@example.com"
"1234"
Type conversions
int() -> Converts to integer data type
float() -> Converts to float data type
str() -> Converts to string data type
bool() -> Converts to boolean data type 

OPERATORS:
RELATIONAL : <,>,==,<=,>=
Conditional: and,or,not Logical AND Operator gives True if all the booleans are true.
Logical OR Operator gives True if any of the booleans are true.
Logical NOT Operator gives the opposite value
